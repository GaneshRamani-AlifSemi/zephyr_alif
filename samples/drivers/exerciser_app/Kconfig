          In case when no files could be listed, because there are none,
          "some.dir" directory and "other.txt" file will be created
          and list will run again to show them. This is useful when
          showing how file system works on non-SD devices like internal
          flash or (Q)SPI connected memories, where it is not possible to
          easily add files with use of other device.
